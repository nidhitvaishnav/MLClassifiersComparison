# MLClassifiersComparison
Given project compares various machine learning classifiers and provides their results on car dataset of UCI Machine learning library.

1. Here, python with Jupyter Notebook has been used to implement different classifiers like Decision Tree, Perceptron,
   Neural Network, Deep Learning, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k Nearest 
   Neighbors, Bagging, Random Forests, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting.

2. For evaluation of classifiers, Car dataset of UCI repository is used. ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation)
Here pandas librery is used to read and preprocess the dataset. 

3. Scikit learn package is used to fit and test the model for all classifiers. 

4. To run the code, you need to run all cells of MLClassifierComparision.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

5. At the beginning we have hyper tuned the code using k-folds. After that we are running all classiifers
 on the same datasets and testing their accuracy and f_score.
